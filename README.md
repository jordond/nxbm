   - To be run locally on your computer, or a NAS server
1. Docker container
   - an All-in-one solution for running **nxbm**
   - All of the runtimes and build tools required
1. Desktop client
   - Using [electron](https://electronjs.org/), you can run **nxbm** as a desktop application

## Requirements

The following are required for running **nxbm**. Unless you use the supplied Docker container.

- Node (v8+)
- Python2

## Installation

WIP

Right now there are no releases as the project is still in early development. However if you would like to try it out anyways, follow these steps.

Open a terminal window:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jordond/nxbm
cd nxbm

# Install all the dependencies
yarn # or `npm install`

# Build and package the standalone version
yarn package:standalone

# The packaged binary will be in ./build/bin/standalone
# Move it elsewhere, or run with node
node ./build/bin/standalone/nxbm.js
```

Once you have the project open, navigate to `localhost:9999` to see the Web UI.

## Configuration

### WIP

After the first run find `./data/config.json`, and edit what you need. Or override the config by passing the flags to the CLI.

ex:

```bash
node ./nxbm.js --port 80 --level verbose --downloadKeys
```

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome! This repository uses [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) as a standard for commit messages. That way a clean changelog can be created. So use `yarn commit` to create your commit message.

This repo is setup as a monorepo using [TypeScript Project References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html). The core functionality of **nxbm** is located in the `lib/` folder, while the consumers of that functionality are located in the `packages/` folder.

### Shared steps

1. Fork the repo, then clone it
1. Install dependencies (`yarn` or `npm install`)

### Working on the `lib` files

1. Run `yarn dev:lib`
1. Make changes and TypeScript will automatically compile them.

### Working on the backend api

1. Follow the steps for working on the `lib` files
1. Open a seperate terminal session
1. Run `yarn dev:api`
1. Webpack will bundle all the files, and watch for changes.

- Webpack will also watch for the output of changes to the `lib` files as well

1. The API will be available at `localhost:9999/api`

### Working on the full stack

1. Follow the steps for working on the `lib` files
1. Open a seperate terminal session
1. Run `yarn dev:bin`
1. The API will be available at `localhost:9999/api`
1. The web ui will be available at `localhost:10000`

### Commiting

1. Run `yarn commit` to create your commit message
