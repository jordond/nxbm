# NEED TO DO

- Fix dev scripts
- Move the dev for the api-backend to standalone
  - When running dev:standalone, set env to "development"
  - When running in dev mode, do not serve the webserver
    - Let the vue-cli handle that (with proxying for api server)
- Ensure web project is still working....
  - see if I can convert all modules to es2015/esnext
    - also modules to commonjs
